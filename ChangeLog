This Log of changes in my package berryFunctions contains two sections:
1. future development - a list of things I want to change
2. development over time - a log of the changes I already made


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. berryFunctions - future development
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- exp4p: allow initial values for optim, try to improve with nls(y~expfun(p,x=x), start=as.list(param) ) 

- lsc: better example dataset, optim problems, sim line not plotted completely

- linReg: grouped density or boxplot(y~group, add=T, at=unique(bpoints), yaxt="n", xlab="", range=0)

- mReg: remove zeros instead of replacing zeros with near-zero values. add hyperbolic functions. copy formula option from linReg.

- pointZoom: rename Argument colp, as col cannot be given currently. Add expr argument

- quantileMean: remove sapply loop if probs has length 1 (if this is faster).

- require2: change to requireNamespace http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html#namespace

- tableColVal: add digits argument

- textField: support srt, Adjust adj parameter based on pos and offset: if(!is.null(pos)), I want the field to still be drawn with adj, but have it based on pos

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. berryFunctions - development over time
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.8 (2015-0-)
various small changes, see the commits on github.
- smallPlot: improved for mfrow situations, coordinates now two vectors instead of 4 numerics
New Functions: panelDim, groupHist, monthAxis


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.7.1 (2014-12-20)
various small changes and bug fixes. See the commits on github
- rmse and rsquare NA-removal warnings can now be silenced with quiet=TRUE
- linReg: formula specification is now enabled: linReg(obj1~obj2) or linReg(col_a~col_b, data=df)
- colPoints can now draw lines (with interpolation amd with NA management) and triangles at legend ends for values outside Range
- classify has new method logscaled and an index for values outside Range
- textField: vertical extend of bounding boxes is now correct through use of expression
- tableColVal: text can be changed (eg logarithmized, see examples)
- createDoc: case now checked. Fixed handling when several args per line or explanations contain 'DEFAULT:'
- logAxis: good internal range and base defaults. exponents. side can be a vector. 
- owa: replaced u with ellipsis. order of arguments is not changed anymore.
- nameSample has been enhanced a lot.
- tableColVal now uses classify
- combineFiles now allows selection of lines
New functions: logSpaced, removeSpace, expReg, dupes


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.6 (2014-10-14)
removed extremeStatLmom from this package, updated package title and description
created a file with deprecated functions
version table removed from berryFunctions package documentation (redundant and outdated information)
Development version is now on Github
"cat" changed to "message" where applicable
- mReg and exp4p documentation updated (minor changes)
- logAxis expanded by log argument to draw the lines on log10(data) but without plot(log="x")
- logAxis argument order improved (side at first place to mimic axis)
- logAxis argument base has new default (1,2,5)
- linReg now also writes rmse. The default line width and pch were changed
- addAlpha now also takes a vector for alpha and yields elementwise alpha-ing
- compareFiles and combineFiles have been renamed for consistency
- seqR: added extendrange argument, rewrote part of the function

New functions: rainbow2, quantileMean, quantileBands, (compareFiles and combineFiles)
removed functions: extremeStatLmom, changeAttribute, showAttribute shapeZoom, (compFiles and combineTextfiles)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.5.2 (2014-09-15)
Functions to be moved to new packages warn about it (extremeStatLmom, changeAttribute, showAttribute and shapeZoom)
- combineTextfiles gained 'names' argument to include filenames in the output
- unitHydrograph: View() in examples only when interactive
- nse, rmse, rqsuare: NA warning now gives numbers

New function: logAxis


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.5 (2014-09-03)
To-Do-list centralized and sorted here, no to-Dos left in source code.
- climateGraph: argument lists for each polygon with owa. sum and avg now at figure margins via mtext.
- createDoc: extreme simplification of creation of usage section. Now creates new .Rd file if one already exists. Backslash handling optimized, but not perfect yet. Now allows latex in arg explanation, but the function start has to be indicated by a single { in an otherwise empty line. "fun" argument does not have to be in quotation marks anymore. Equal sign in defaults now handled correctly.
- logVals: Default values for 'from' and 'to' changed
- seqR: range is now first argument, so it doesn't have to be given each time. min and max argument "finite" changed to "na.rm".
- tableColVal: argument lists for each text group, allowing srt etc.
- owa: throws an understandable error when unnamed arguments are in the list
- lsc: now warns when sum under UH is !=1. Calculation time Rcmd check in examples reduced. nse and rmse explicitly called from this package.
- mReg: exp_4p outsourced, rsquare and rmse taken from package, R^2 is now calculated on the actual fit, not its linearization
- require2 received the alias library2
- colPoints, colPointsLegend: generally rewritten. classification methods, cpHist and smallPlot added.
- extremeStatLmom: code for legend arguments improved (with owa) 
- packages lmom and spatstat were moved from "suggests" to "imports", as they are within functions and not just in the examples.

New functions: normPlot, betaPlot, exp4p, compFiles, funTinn, pretty2, colPointsHist, classify, smallPlot
functions removed: compareDoc (Rcmd check does this better, once a package is set up), extremeStat (replaced with extremeStatLmom)


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.4 (2014-07-01)
Added To-Do list with my personal wishes (and some comments from other people) at the top of this ChangeLog. Examples in several functions received line breaks / shortening
- extremeStatLmom: p.value by ks.test as measure for goodness of fit addded. Output is now data.frame instead of matrix. Value field in Doc is complemented. Examples are updated.
- lsc: example QP-Data is now a file in the package folder extdata, not a dropbox link anymore (files were accidentally deleted and it was too slow anyways). P and Q labels are now placed in the outer margin.
- mReg: ditto for temp data

New function: linLogTrans


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.3 (2014-06-08)
Description field much more verbose
Shapefile (6 MB) removed from data
examples in changeAttribute, showAttribute, shapeZoom changed accordingly


-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.2 (2014-06-06)

email address in DESCRIPTION Maintainer Field (how could I possibly miss that typo?!) is now corrected.
This ChangeLog is now reformated to create a standard layout.
A lot of examples have received line breaks (they were longer than 100 chars).

berryFunctions-package: examples completed and grouped
createDoc: seealso extended.
funnelPLot and mReg: owa removed from function body
lsc: argument returnsim included, output now vector. psi incluced. catchment area included, examples and documentation updated
logVals: description updated
owa: programming example included, description changed.
combineTextfiles: example added.
require2: example is set to dontrun
