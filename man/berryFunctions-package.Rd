\title{Berry's functions}
\description{
Draw horizontal histograms, color scattered points by 3rd dimension, enhance date- and log-axis plots, zoom in X11 graphics, trace errors and warnings, use the unit hydrograph in a linear storage cascade, convert lists to data.frames and arrays, fit multiple functions.
}
\note{
Collection of functions, mainly connected with graphics and hydrology.\cr
- zoom in X11 graphics\cr
- plot rainfall-runoff data and optimize parameters for the unit hydrograph in the linear storage cascade\cr
- write text to plots on top of colored fields in label size (halo-effect)\cr
- draw scatterplots colored by 3rd dimension (as in image, which only deals with grids)\cr
- draw histograms horizontally\cr
- advancedly label date axes and logarithmic axes\cr
- fit multiple functions (power, reciprocal, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, rational) by regression\cr
- convert lists to data.frames\cr
- and more...

At some places you'll find \code{## not run} in the examples. These code
blocks were excluded from checking while building, mainly because they are
interactive and need mouseclicks, or because they open another device/file.
Normally, you should be able to run them in an interactive session. If you
do find non-executable code, please tell me!\cr
Feel free to suggest packages in which these functions would fit well.\cr
I strongly depend on - and therefore welcome - any feedback!\cr\cr
